            <h3>1. It's fast</h3>
            <p>
                Code written in C++ is fast - much faster than code written in PHP. When you start using C++, you bring down <a href="#">your CPU and memory</a> load, and your web pages instantly become more responsive. You can bring down the hardware costs, because you simply need less servers to handle the same number of page views.
            </p>

            <h3>
                2. It is shockingly simple
            </h3>

            <p>
                C and C++ have a reputation of being difficult and complex. But just take a look at the examples in our documentation and surprise yourself. The simple reality is that algorithms written in C++ look almost identical to algorithms written in PHP. If you know how to program in PHP, you can easily learn how to do the same in C++.
